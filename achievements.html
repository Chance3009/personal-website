                    <h2>Champion - The 3rd Sunway University Mandarin Debate Tournament</h2>
                    <p class="date">Date: January, 2024</p>
                    <p>The 3rd Sunway University Mandarin Debate Tournament (SUMDT 3.0), organized by the Sunway
                        University Chinese Cultural Society (Debate Division) is an annual competition dedicated to
                        discovering and nurturing emerging debate talents within university students, providing an
                        exclusive platform for novices in collegiate debate.<br><br>

                        Our team clinched the championship in the 3rd Sunway University Mandarin Debate Tournament
                        (SUMDT
                        3.0), prevailing over 17 other competing teams from diverse universities and colleges across
                        Malaysia. Securing the championship was not an easy feat. With final examinations scheduled
                        on
                        the second day, we had to juggle intense academic pressure and debate preparation.<br><br>

                        This win wouldn't have been possible without the incredible support of my teammates and the
                        invaluable guidance of my mentor. As a first-time debater, stepping onto the stage was
                        daunting.
                        Their belief in me was what pushed me beyond my limits.

                    <p class="date">Date: October, 2023</p>
                    <p>The i-Hax Hackathon 2023, hosted by the International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM), is
                        a

                        theme
                        focuses on educational empowerment.<br><br>

                        Our team, Carry Mee, secured 6th place overall among the 20 finalist teams by showcasing

                        the
                        importance of inclusive learning environments, and the necessity for holistic well-being in

                    <h2>Top 16 - Hilti IT Competition 2023</h2>
                    <p class="date">Date: May, 2023</p>
                    <p>The Hilti IT Competition (ITC) is an annual IT competition which challenges students around the
                        world to develop innovative solutions to overcome challenges faced by the construction industry.
                        ITC 2023 was themed around Industry 4.0: Revolutionize the Construction Industry.<br><br>

                        Our team, Energetic KLCC, proposed an idea for the competition which we called the Smart Hard
                        Hat. Our concept aimed to improve the safety of construction workers by using built-in sensors
                        to monitor their biometric data and environmental conditions, allowing supervisors to detect
                        potential hazards and take appropriate actions. Despite the tough competition and the high level
                        of submissions from 656 participants representing 31 nationalities, we were proud to advance to
                        the semifinals as one of the Top 16 teams.<br><br>

                        As the first-ever competition our entire team joined at university, we never anticipated
                        achieving such impressive results, especially in a competition as challenging as the Hilti IT
                        Competition (ITC) 2023.</p>
